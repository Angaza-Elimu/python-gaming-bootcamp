# Python Programming Bootcamp - 5 Day Curriculum

A comprehensive Python programming bootcamp designed for high school beginners. This repository contains complete lesson plans, code examples, and three fully functional Pygame projects.

## 📚 Course Overview

This 5-day intensive bootcamp takes students from zero programming experience to building their own games. Each day builds on the previous, with hands-on projects and real-world examples.

### Day 1: Getting Started & Python Fundamentals
- Introduction to programming concepts
- Installing Python & VS Code
- Variables and data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- User input and output
- Arithmetic operations
- **Projects**: Greeting Bot, Math Quiz, Simple Calculator

### Day 2: Decisions, Logic & Loops
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Boolean logic and comparison operators
- For loops and while loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- **Projects**: Login System, Grade Calculator, Rock Paper Scissors

### Day 3: Working With Collections
- Lists and list manipulation
- Tuples for immutable data
- Dictionaries and key-value pairs
- Nested data structures
- **Projects**: Contact Book, RPG Inventory System

### Day 4: Functions & Code Organization
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Code organization best practices
- Basic debugging techniques
- **Projects**: Password Generator, Interactive Quiz App, To-Do List Manager

### Day 5: Introduction to Game Development
- Installing Pygame library
- Understanding the game loop
- Drawing shapes and handling input
- Collision detection
- **Projects**: Catch the Falling Objects game

## 🎮 Featured Game Projects

This repository includes three complete, playable games built with Pygame:

### 1. 🐍 Snake Game
Classic snake gameplay with modern features:
- Smooth snake movement with WASD/Arrow controls
- Score tracking and high score system
- Progressive speed increase
- Clean UI with game states (menu, playing, game over)

**Key Concepts**: Grid-based movement, collision detection, dynamic list management

### 2. 👻 Pacman Game
Full recreation of the arcade classic:
- 19x21 maze with pellets and power pellets
- Four colored ghosts with AI pathfinding
- Frightened mode when power pellet is consumed
- Tunnel wrapping, lives system, scoring
- Win/lose conditions

**Key Concepts**: AI pathfinding, game state management, sprite animation, level design

### 3. 🚀 Space Invaders
Arcade-style space shooter:
- Multiple alien types with different point values
- Progressive difficulty (aliens speed up as fleet decreases)
- Bonus UFO with random point values
- Particle explosion effects
- Parallax starfield background
- Invincibility frames after being hit
- Multi-level progression

**Key Concepts**: Entity management, particle systems, projectile physics, wave spawning
